Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
My name is flrsgab, and I'm a big fan of football, gaming, and data science. I'm currently learning machine learning algorithms and applying them to various datasets to gain insights and make predictions.

ðŸš€ What I'm working on
Right now, I'm focusing on improving my understanding of various machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks. I'm also working on personal projects that involve analyzing sports data and building predictive models.

ðŸ’» My GitHub projects
You can find some of my recent projects on my GitHub profile, where I've built things like housing price predictions. 
My next projects are  -> football match predictor and a sentiment analysis tool for video game reviews.

ðŸ“« How to reach me
If you want to get in touch with me, you can find me on Instagram (flrsgab) or LinkedIn (gabenricoflores). I'm always happy to chat about football, gaming, data science, or anything else!

Thanks for stopping by, and happy coding! ðŸ¤“
